1. SQL Injection (js/sql-injection):
• Multiple instances are reported where user-provided values are used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
• This vulnerability is highly exploitable as attackers can manipulate the SQL queries to access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
• The cost of addressing this vulnerability is relatively low. It requires properly sanitizing user inputs and using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
• SQL injection is considered a severe vulnerability as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised database integrity.
• To fix this, the development team should review all instances where user inputs are used in SQL queries and ensure proper input validation and the use of parameterized queries.

2. Missing Rate Limiting (js/missing-rate-limiting):
• The report highlights route handlers that perform file system access or authorization without any rate limiting mechanism in place.
• This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by overwhelming the server with a high volume of requests.
• Implementing rate limiting requires some effort to determine appropriate rate limits, track and throttle requests, and handle rate-limited responses gracefully.
• The severity of this vulnerability depends on the criticality of the affected routes and the potential impact of a DoS attack on the system's availability.
• The development team should assess the identified routes and implement suitable rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure the system's stability.

3. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (js/reflected-xss):
The report identifies instances where user-provided values are directly included in the server's response without proper encoding or validation.
Reflected XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application's pages, leading to unauthorized actions or theft of sensitive user information.
Addressing reflected XSS vulnerabilities requires proper encoding or sanitization of user-provided values before including them in the server's response.
The severity of reflected XSS depends on the sensitivity of the data handled by the affected pages and the potential impact on user security.
The development team should review the identified instances and implement appropriate encoding or validation techniques to prevent XSS attacks.
